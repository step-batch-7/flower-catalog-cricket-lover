            Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical
            and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family
            Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
            America and Mexico but four are native to the United States. They
            form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The
            opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins
            are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters.
            The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and
            spread in small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
