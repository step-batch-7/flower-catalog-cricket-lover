				<p>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
					Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
					the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
					Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
					where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
					seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
					white, not yellow, flowers.
					It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
					are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,
					
					pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-
					duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they
					
					are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
					
					corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm di-
					ameter.
					
					It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North
					America.</p>
