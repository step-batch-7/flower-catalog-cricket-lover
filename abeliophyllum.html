            Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf) is a monotypic
            genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists
            of one species, Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
            where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites.
            It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow,
            flowers. It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
            are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide, pubescent both
            above and below. The flowers are pro- duced in early spring before
            the new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long,
            with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3
            cm di- ameter. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and
            North America.
